I really liked the sculpted [DCS family](http://keycapsdirect.com/pdfs/DCSFamily.pdf) from Signature Plastics but couldn't find too many resources on what you need to build a DCS keycap set for the Ergodox. Overall, spherical seems to be the preferred (and cheaper) choice for this. The biggest issue you will face is that there are no vertical 1.5 keys in the DCS family, and you need to reuse the 1.5 horizontal keys for your vertical ones. This is broadly what you need :

* 1.5xR1 x2
* 1.5xR2 x4
* 1.5xR3 x4
* 1.5xR4 x2
* 1xR1 x16
* 1xR2 x14
* 1xR3 x8
* 1xR3 x2 (homing bar)
* 1xR4 x20
* 1xR2 x4 (vertical)

My actual configuration is slightly different because I used keys from multiple rows to give a better feel on Row 1, you can see the full config with colours and applicable rows [here](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/layouts/e92ae592ef1834e9b13fc7ad969ad8b0). I used 2x R2 x1.5 and 2 x R3 x 1.5 for the 1.5 verticals, with coloured accents for the corner keys, all in PBT. The stock on the vertical keys varies, so you might have to make some substitutions.
